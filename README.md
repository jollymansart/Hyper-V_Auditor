I am just a few months away before uploading this wonderful tool you can not live without.

message me and i will get a preview.  just finalizing a few of the new enhancements.
in the mean time tell me what things you would like to see in a output report and I will see what i can do.

I will deploy the initial script in powershell, but if you would like it in other languages c#/Python/jscript just let me know.
